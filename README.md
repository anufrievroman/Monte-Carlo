# Monte Carlo

This is the repository of phonon Monte Carlo code created by Roman Anufriev in the University of Tokyo in 2018-2020

The code simulates trajectories of phonons in 3D model of a structure, which consists of a box (membrane) with holes and/or pillars of different shapes. The alghoritm can calculate the heat fluxes, temperature profiles, the thermal conductivity of the structure, and lots of other things.
