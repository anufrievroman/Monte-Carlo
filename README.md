# Monte Carlo

This is the repository of Monte Carlo code created by Roman Anufriev in the University of Tokyo in 2018

This is python 2.7 code, to run it you should install the Anaconda 2, then open the code in the installed Spyder editor and run it.
The code simulates trajectories of phonons in 3D model of a structure, which consists of a box (membrane) with holes and/or pillars of different shapes. The alghoritm can calculate the heat fluxes, temperature profiles, and the thermal conductivity of the structure.
