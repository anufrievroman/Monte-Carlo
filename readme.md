# Monte Carlo

This is the repository of phonon Monte Carlo code created by Roman Anufriev in the University of Tokyo in 2018-2021

The code simulates trajectories of phonons in 3D model of a structure, which consists of a box (membrane) with holes and/or pillars of different shapes. The alghoritm can calculate the heat fluxes, temperature profiles, the thermal conductivity of the structure, and lots of other things. See [the wiki pages](https://github.com/anufrievroman/Monte-Carlo/wiki/General-algorithm-flow) for the details of the simulation.
